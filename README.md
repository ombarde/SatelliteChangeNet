Summary of the proposed research and expected deliverables
Change detection and prediction using satellite data have significant applications in various domains such as new build-up area detection, urban development analysis, disaster management, and agriculture.
Traditional methods often struggle to handle the complexity and diversity of satellite data. Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) provide a novel approach to address these challenges by offering dynamic and adaptive computation. This proposal outlines a research project focused on utilizing LNNs for change detection and prediction tasks using satellite imagery.
LNNs are more dynamic, adaptive, efficient, and robust than traditional neural networks and have many potential use cases for satellite image data analysis.
This research project aims to leverage the applicability of Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) based deep learning method for change detection and prediction tasks using multi-temporal satellite data. The outcomes of this project have the potential to enhance our capabilities in understanding and managing various environmental and societal changes. By combining the adaptability of LNNs with analysis of satellite imagery, it is proposed to create more accurate and efficient tools for change analysis.
Scope of the Work:
Develop a Liquid Neural Network (LNN) Architecture: Design and implement an LNN architecture suitable for analysing multi-temporal satellite imagery for change detection and prediction.
Dataset Collection and Preprocessing: Gather multi-temporal satellite datasets that encompass various types of changes, such as land cover changes, urban expansion, natural disasters, etc.
Pre-process the data to ensure consistency, alignment, and suitability for training LNNs.
Change Detection: Train the LNN model to identify changes between pairs of satellite images taken at different times. The model should be capable of highlighting regions with significant alterations.
Change Prediction: Extend the LNN's capabilities to predict potential changes in future satellite images based on historical data. This involves training the model to learn patterns and trends in changes over time.
Evaluation Metrics: Define appropriate evaluation metrics for both change detection and change prediction tasks. Common metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy can be used.
Linkages to Space Programme:
LNN is an emerging technology for reducing the turnaround time to detect any changes in the spectral and temporal progression of biophysical and physical phenomena.
This work will enable us to address some of the existing gap areas of satellite data analysis using LNN architecture, its suitability, feature extraction, change detection and change prediction.
